# WLED Android Native App

## Usage Note

This Android application is part of the Ignis WLED Controller project for **testing and research purposes only**. It has been added as a reference to understand the functioning of the WLED library and communication protocol.

**This application will not be further developed within this project.** Instead, we are developing our own multiplatform implementation using Expo React Native, which will be available in the `/apps/expo-app` directory.

## Origin

This application is a copy of [WLED-native-android](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED-native-android) created by the original author of the WLED project. It has been added to this repository without Git history.

## License

The original application is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED-native-android/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Acknowledgements

We thank [Aircoookie](https://github.com/Aircoookie) and all contributors to the original WLED project and native Android application for their excellent work, which has allowed us to better understand the WLED ecosystem.
